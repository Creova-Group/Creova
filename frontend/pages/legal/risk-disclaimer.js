          3. Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Risks
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="md">
          Using Creova involves inherent risks tied to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, including:
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="md" as="ul" pl={6} listStyleType="disc">
          <Text as="li">Volatility: The value of Ether (ETH) and other digital assets can fluctuate significantly, potentially leading to substantial financial losses.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Smart Contract Risks: Although our smart contracts are designed with security in mind and undergo audits, they may contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited, resulting in loss of funds.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Irreversibility: Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are final and cannot be reversed or modified by Creova once executed.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Gas Fees: Ethereum network transaction fees (‚Äúgas‚Äù) vary based on network congestion and are borne entirely by users. These fees can be unpredictable and may increase operational costs.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Security Breaches: Users are solely responsible for securing their private keys, wallet credentials, and devices. Creova is not liable for losses due to hacking, phishing, or compromised wallets.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Network Downtime: Ethereum network outages or forks may disrupt access to the Platform or funds, over which Creova has no control.</Text>
        </Text>

          4. Project & Funding Risks
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="md">
          Participation in public goods crowdfunding or treasury grants on Creova carries the following risks:
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="md" as="ul" pl={6} listStyleType="disc">
          <Text as="li">No Guaranteed Outcomes: Contributions to projects do not guarantee financial returns, rewards, or successful completion. Funding is at your own risk.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Creator Responsibility: Project creators are solely accountable for delivering on their stated goals. Creova does not oversee, manage, or guarantee project execution.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Misuse of Funds: Creators may mismanage or misuse funds raised. Funders must independently assess the credibility of creators and projects before contributing.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Crowdfunding Specifics: Funds contributed to crowdfunding campaigns remain with creators after the 30-day deadline, even if the funding goal is not met, with no refund available.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Treasury Grant Specifics: Treasury funds are subject to milestone approvals by voters or administrators. Delays, rejections, or failure to meet milestones may result in unspent funds being returned to the treasury, not funders.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Treasury Fund Misuse: In cases of suspected fraud or mismanagement, Creova reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate action, including legal recourse if necessary.</Text>

          5. Regulatory & Compliance Risks
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="md" as="ul" pl={6} listStyleType="disc">
          <Text as="li">Legal Uncertainty: Cryptocurrency and blockchain regulations vary by jurisdiction and may evolve. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with their local laws, including tax obligations.</Text>
          <Text as="li">KYC & AML Requirements: Users applying for treasury grants or withdrawing over 5 ETH (or equivalent in GBP at the prevailing rate) must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Failure to complete KYC verification may result in funds being temporarily frozen or permanently inaccessible if verification is declined.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Sanctions & Restrictions: Users from jurisdictions subject to UK sanctions (e.g., Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) list) are prohibited from using Creova. Violation may result in frozen funds or legal action.</Text>

        <Text fontSize="xl" fontWeight="semibold" mb={2}>
          6. Third-Party Service Risks
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="md" as="ul" pl={6} listStyleType="disc">
          <Text as="li">KYC Provider: Identity verification is managed by third-party providers (e.g., Sumsub). Creova is not responsible for delays, errors, or data breaches occurring within their systems. Users acknowledge that KYC verification results are final and Creova has no authority to override decisions made by its KYC provider.</Text>
          <Text as="li">IPFS Storage: Project data stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) relies on third-party nodes. Creova does not guarantee the availability, integrity, or permanence of this data.</Text>
          <Text as="li">Ethereum Network: The Platform depends on the Ethereum blockchain, operated by third parties. Creova is not liable for network-related disruptions.</Text>
