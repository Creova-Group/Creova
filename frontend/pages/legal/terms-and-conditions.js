          9. Risk Disclaimer
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="md">
          Volatility: Cryptocurrency (ETH) values are highly volatile, and
          funding projects carries financial risk.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="md" mt={2}>
          Project Risks: Creova does not vet or endorse projects. Creators may
